Concept-Scripts-Features
========================

Scripts that are either Un-Tested or simple concepts that have yet to be hard coded.

// Please use the same README.cs in GameBuilds along with these additional rules

// New Concepts that have no hard coding should be made as follows:
  
    /* 1) Description of concept
       2) Thought process behind code
       3) Suggestions for variable/method names
    */
    
// New Concepts that are hard coded should be made with the following:

  /* 1) What needs to be done before it can be tested
     2) What specifically is working and not working
     3) Goal of the feature/script
  */
