WIP-Scripts
===========

// Scripts that are Tested but not fully functional or require more coding for complete feature implementation.

// Follow README in the GameBuilds section plus the follow guidelines:

// If script is tested and has compiler errors

  /* 1) Describe nature of the error
     2) Copy/Paste error code from console to top of script in comment line
     3) Comment you intentions with the non-functional code next to the line that is not working
  */
  

// If script is tested and has no errors but still requires more coding for full implementation

  /* 1) State at top goal of the script
     2) Write in comments where the new code to finish script should be
     3) Write what the required code must do in the comment as well
  */
